Files:

	•	CodeBook.rtf is a code book that describes the criteria for this assignment, the data, the variables, and any work performed to clean up the data 
	•	run_analysis.R  downloads the data and follows the 5 steps required in the project’s definition:

	    1.	Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set.
	    2.	Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
	    3.	Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
	    4.	Appropriately label the data set with descriptive variable names. 
	    5.	Create a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
  
	•	TidyData.txt and TidyData.csv are the exported products of the above transformations
